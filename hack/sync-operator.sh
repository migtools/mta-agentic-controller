# Render this repo's operator-facing manifests into a checkout of
# konveyor/operator (a.k.a. tackle2-operator).
#
# The operator ships the agentic controller as an operand: its CRDs, its RBAC,
# and the curated default content (the skill catalog, the stage Agents, and the
# AgentWorkflow the UI runs). Those artifacts are defined HERE and copied there
# -- a hand-maintained second copy would drift. This script is that copy step,
# run by .github/workflows/sync-operator.yml on every merge and runnable
# locally to preview the result.
#
# What it renders:
#   CRDs       config/crd/bases/konveyor.io_*.yaml -> helm/templates/crds/ (verbatim)
#   RBAC       config/rbac/{role,leader_election_role}.yaml -> helm/templates/rbac/
#                agentic_{cluster_role,leader_election_role}.yaml, with metadata.name
#                renamed to avoid colliding with the operator's own roles
#   deployment config/operator/deployment.yaml.j2 -> roles/tackle/templates/agentic/ (verbatim)
#   defaults   config/defaults/*.yaml -> roles/tackle/templates/agentic/defaults/ (verbatim)
#
# It does NOT run `make bundle`; the workflow does that in the operator checkout
# so the ClusterServiceVersion reflects any CRD/RBAC change. The RBAC binding and
# ServiceAccount files are operator-authored (they reference the operator's
# release namespace and SA name) and are intentionally left alone -- only the two
# role files, whose rules are generated from the controller, are re-rendered.
