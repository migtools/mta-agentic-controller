# Getting Started

This guide walks through deploying the agentic controller, creating a
Gateway with LLM credentials, defining an Agent, and creating an
AgentRun to trigger execution.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.33+ or OpenShift 4.20+ (the controller mounts skills via
  the ImageVolume feature — a beta gate that is **off by default** on
  Kubernetes 1.33–1.34, so enable `ImageVolume` there; it is on by
  default from 1.35 and GA in 1.36)
- [Agent Sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox)
  v1.0.x installed in the cluster
- [Konveyor Hub](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub) installed in
  the cluster (step 2 covers this). Hub serves the agentic API the UI
  uses and resolves the repositories agents migrate; Hub-free runs are
  not supported yet
  ([#122](https://github.com/konveyor/agentic-controller/issues/122))
- `kubectl` and `helm` configured to talk to the cluster
- LLM provider credentials (e.g. GCP Vertex AI, OpenAI, Anthropic,
  AWS Bedrock)

> **Everything agentic lives in the Hub namespace.** Hub reads Agents,
> AgentRuns, Gateways, SkillCards and the other `konveyor.io` resources
> from its **own** namespace and nowhere else — there is no setting to
> point it elsewhere. Every `kubectl apply` and `kubectl create secret`
> in this guide therefore targets that namespace, `konveyor-tackle` by
> default, via `$KONVEYOR_NS`. Applying the Gateways or defaults into a
> different namespace (or leaving them in whatever your context happens
> to be) is the single most common way to end up with a UI that shows an
> error on every agentic page; see
> [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## 1. Install Agent Sandbox

The controller creates Agent Sandbox CRs to run agent workloads.
Agent Sandbox must be installed before the controller can execute
AgentRuns.

```bash
AGENT_SANDBOX_TAG=v1.0.0

# Clone and install via Helm
git clone --depth 1 --branch $AGENT_SANDBOX_TAG \
  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox.git /tmp/agent-sandbox

# The chart renders its own Namespace by default; disable it with
# namespace.create=false so it does not collide with --create-namespace.
helm install agent-sandbox /tmp/agent-sandbox/helm/ \
  --namespace agent-sandbox-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set namespace.create=false \
  --set image.tag=$AGENT_SANDBOX_TAG

# Wait for the controller to be ready
kubectl wait deployment/agent-sandbox-controller \
  --namespace agent-sandbox-system \
  --for=condition=Available \
  --timeout=120s
```

> **Note:** The clone + `helm install` path above and the upstream
> release manifest (`kubectl apply -f .../<tag>/sandbox-with-extensions.yaml`)
> are **alternative** install methods — use one, not both. Mixing them
> makes helm and `kubectl apply` fight over the same cluster-scoped CRDs,
> and backing out means deleting those CRDs (taking every Sandbox on the
> cluster with them). Note also that the release assets were renamed at
> v0.5.2 (`manifest.yaml` → `sandbox.yaml`), so pin a v0.5.2+ tag if you
> follow the release-manifest path.

> **Upgrading an existing cluster:** Agent Sandbox v1.0.0 removes the
> legacy `v1alpha1` API and its conversion webhooks, so you **cannot**
> jump straight to it from v0.4.x / early v0.5.x. Follow the upstream
> [v1.0.0 API migration guide](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/blob/v1.0.0/docs/api-migration-guide.md)
> in order: (1) upgrade to a v0.5.x release; (2) run the
> [v0.5 storage migration](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/blob/v0.5.2/docs/api-migration-guide.md)
> to move all resources to `v1beta1` and prune legacy `storedVersions`;
> (3) verify every agent-sandbox CRD reports only `["v1beta1"]` in
> `status.storedVersions` (the apiserver rejects the upgrade otherwise);
> (4) upgrade to v1.0.0. Because Helm does **not** upgrade CRDs in a
> chart's `crds/` directory, apply the v1beta1 CRDs
> (`kubectl apply -f helm/crds/`) *before* `helm upgrade` — otherwise the
> chart removes the conversion-webhook Service while the old CRDs still
> reference it. Fresh installs (the command above) are unaffected.

> **Future:** [OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) will
> replace the direct Agent Sandbox dependency. When integrated, the
> controller will provision sandboxes through the OpenShell gateway
> API instead of creating Sandbox CRs directly. See
> [ADR 0004](adr/0004-openshell-as-execution-interface.md).

## 2. Install Konveyor Hub

Hub is where the agentic resources live and what the UI talks to. Install
it before creating any Gateway or Agent so there is a namespace to put
them in. `hack/install-konveyor.sh` installs the tackle2-operator via its
Helm chart, waits for Hub, and grants Hub's ServiceAccount access to the
`konveyor.io` resources in its namespace (`config/hub-rbac/`). Operators
from [konveyor/operator#614](https://github.com/konveyor/operator/pull/614)
(v0.11.0-alpha.4) on grant this themselves; the script pins an older commit,
and the grant is harmless next to a newer one:

```bash
export KONVEYOR_NS=konveyor-tackle   # the script's default; change both together
make konveyor-install                # add AUTH_REQUIRED=true to start with auth on
```

Authentication is off by default so the rest of this guide needs no
credentials; [Authentication](#authentication) below covers turning it
on and what changes when you do.

Every command below uses `-n "$KONVEYOR_NS"`. If you prefer, set it as
your context default instead and drop the flag:

```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace="$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

Already have a Hub? Skip the install but still grant the RBAC (needed for
operators before v0.11.0-alpha.4, harmless after). This is the one way to
apply `config/hub-rbac/`: the RoleBinding names the ServiceAccount's
namespace, which `-n` does not rewrite, so render and substitute:

```bash
kubectl kustomize config/hub-rbac/ \
  | sed "s/konveyor-tackle/$KONVEYOR_NS/g" \
  | kubectl apply -f -
```

## 3. Deploy the controller and default resources

> **Operator path (no build, no kustomize).** The tackle2-operator ships
> the agentic controller. One switch on the Tackle CR deploys the
> controller into the Hub namespace, installs the same `config/defaults/`
> content there, and turns on the agentic pages in the UI:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl patch tackle tackle -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" --type merge \
>   -p '{"spec":{"agentic_enabled":true}}'
> kubectl get tackle tackle -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" \
>   -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="AgenticControllerReady")]}'
> ```
>
> Agent Sandbox (step 1) must already be installed or the operator posts
> `AgenticControllerReady=False` and deploys nothing. If you take this path,
> skip `make deploy` and `kubectl apply -k config/defaults/` below — two
> controllers reconciling the same CRs is not a supported setup — and
> continue at [Open the UI](#open-the-ui). The developer path below is for
> running your own build of the controller.

The default image `quay.io/konveyor/agentic-controller:latest` is public
and rebuilt on every merge to `main`, so you can deploy straight away
with no build step:

```bash
# Deploy CRDs, RBAC, and the controller manager
make deploy
```

To build and push your own image instead (e.g. to test local changes),
set `IMG` to a registry you can push to:

```bash
export IMG=quay.io/<your-org>/agentic-controller:dev
make docker-build docker-push IMG=$IMG
make deploy IMG=$IMG
```

This creates the `agentic-controller-system` namespace and deploys
the controller. Verify it's running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n agentic-controller-system
```

> **Upgrading a running controller:** rerun `make deploy IMG=$IMG` rather
> than restarting the pod or patching the Deployment's image. Two things are
> versioned with the image and only `make deploy` re-applies them: the
> manager ClusterRole, and the `SKILL_LOADER_IMAGE` env var (the image
> carrying `/skill-loader`, normally the controller's own — kustomize keeps
> it equal to the manager image). A bare `kubectl rollout restart` onto a
> newer image crash-loops on the missing env var, and a stale ClusterRole
> shows up as `Failed to watch ... forbidden` in the controller log. If you
> manage the Deployment outside kustomize, set `SKILL_LOADER_IMAGE` to the
> manager image yourself.

Deploy the default domain resources — the SkillCards and SkillCollection
that make up the skill catalog, plus the Agents and the
`java-ee-to-quarkus` AgentWorkflow the UI presents for users to run
(these are not included in `make deploy` to avoid name-prefix mangling
the cross-references between them). This is the same content the operator
installs on enable. They must land in the Hub namespace (see step 2) or
the UI cannot see them:

```bash
kubectl apply -k config/defaults/ -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

The shipped Agents declare no gateway, so they install and become Ready
without a provider configured — you name a gateway when you run one (step
4 creates one). Inspect what was installed:

```bash
kubectl get skillcards,skillcollections,agents,agentworkflows -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

> **Samples vs. defaults.** `config/defaults/` holds the curated content
> above — installed automatically by the operator. `config/samples/` holds
> illustrative CRs you copy and edit (the Gateway samples in step 4, plus a
> standalone example Agent and AgentRun); nothing there is auto-installed.

To install only the CRDs without deploying the controller (e.g. for
local development with `make run`):

```bash
make install
```

Alternatively, generate a single consolidated YAML containing CRDs
and the controller deployment — useful when you don't want to build
from source:

```bash
make build-installer IMG=$IMG
kubectl apply -f dist/install.yaml
```

### Open the UI

Before creating anything else, confirm Hub can see what you just
installed. This is the check that catches a wrong namespace or missing
RBAC immediately instead of at the end of the guide. Through the Hub
service:

```bash
kubectl -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" port-forward svc/tackle-hub 8080:8080 &
curl -s http://localhost:8080/agentic/agents | jq -r '.[].name'
```

You should see the default Agents (`migration-plan-agent`,
`migration-execute-agent`, `migration-verify-agent`). A `500` with
`is forbidden` in the body means the
RBAC or the namespace is wrong — see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). Add `-u admin:admin` once
authentication is on.

The operator exposes the UI as a Route named `tackle` on OpenShift
(`openshift_cluster: true` on the Tackle CR) or an Ingress named `tackle`
otherwise; on a Kind cluster without an ingress controller, port-forward
it:

```bash
kubectl -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" get route,ingress tackle 2>/dev/null
kubectl -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" port-forward svc/tackle-ui 8081:8080   # then http://localhost:8081
```

The agentic pages (Agent runs, Agents, Workflows, Skills) appear only when
the UI runs with `AGENTIC_ENABLED=true`. The operator sets that together
with `agentic_enabled`, so on the operator path they are already there.
On the developer path the operator-managed UI keeps them hidden; run a
second UI Deployment of your own with `AGENTIC_ENABLED=true` and
`TACKLE_HUB_URL=http://tackle-hub.$KONVEYOR_NS.svc:8080` (plus the
authentication variables in [Authentication](#authentication) if auth is
on), or rely on the API check above.

## 4. Create a Gateway

A Gateway represents a single LLM provider/model combination with
credentials. Each Gateway serves exactly one model. The Gateway and the
Secret it references must both be in the Hub namespace — the controller
resolves `credentialRef` within the Gateway's own namespace, and Hub only
lists Gateways from its own.

> **Note:** Gateway replaces the former `LLMProvider` CRD. If you
> have existing `LLMProvider` resources, they must be recreated as
> Gateways — one Gateway per provider/model combination.

The Secret commands below use `--from-literal` for brevity, which
records the key value in your shell history. For anything beyond a
throwaway test cluster, prefer `--from-file` (reading the value from a
protected file) or an external secret manager.

### Option A: GCP Vertex AI

Create a Secret with your GCP application default credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login

kubectl create secret generic vertex-credentials -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" \
  --from-file=GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON="$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json" \
  --from-literal=GCP_PROJECT_ID="$(gcloud config get-value project)" \
  --from-literal=GCP_LOCATION=global
```

The whole Secret is exposed to the agent via `envFrom`, so `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
and `GCP_LOCATION` ride along with the credentials file. goose's Vertex
provider **requires** `GCP_PROJECT_ID` (there is no default and the run
fails at first token without it). `GCP_LOCATION` is optional — goose
defaults to `us-central1` — but `global` matches the sample Gateway
endpoint.

Apply the Gateway:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/gateway_vertex_ai.yaml -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

### Option B: OpenAI

```bash
kubectl create secret generic openai-credentials -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" \
  --from-literal=api-key="<your-openai-api-key>"

kubectl apply -f config/samples/gateway_openai.yaml -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

### Option C: Anthropic

```bash
kubectl create secret generic anthropic-credentials -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" \
  --from-literal=api-key="<your-anthropic-api-key>"

kubectl apply -f config/samples/gateway_anthropic.yaml -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

### Option D: AWS Bedrock

```bash
kubectl create secret generic bedrock-credentials -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" \
  --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<your-access-key-id>" \
  --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<your-secret-access-key>" \
  --from-literal=AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

kubectl apply -f config/samples/gateway_aws_bedrock.yaml -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

`AWS_REGION` is what goose actually uses to reach Bedrock — the harness
derives the Bedrock endpoint from it and ignores the Gateway `endpoint`,
which only feeds the controller's connectivity check. Keep the Gateway
`endpoint` in the same region as `AWS_REGION` so that check stays
meaningful. The model's `us.` prefix is a **cross-region inference
profile** spanning the US regions (us-east-1/us-east-2/us-west-2), so
switching between US regions needs no model change — only moving to
another geo (`eu.`, `apac.`) requires a new prefix.

### Option E: xAI (Grok)

```bash
kubectl create secret generic grok-credentials -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" \
  --from-literal=api-key="<your-xai-api-key>"

kubectl apply -f config/samples/gateway_xai.yaml -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

Verify the Gateway is ready:

```bash
kubectl get gateways.konveyor.io -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

> **Note:** Use the fully-qualified `gateways.konveyor.io` rather than the
> bare `gateways`. On any cluster with the Gateway API CRDs installed
> (OpenShift 4.19+ does this by default), `gateways` resolves to
> `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` instead, so `kubectl get gateways`
> would report no resources right after you applied your Gateway.

The `Verified` column shows whether the controller confirmed
connectivity to the endpoint.

## 5. Create an Agent

An Agent is a template that declares what is available for execution:
a container image, gateways, skills, a prompt, and typed parameters.
Creating an Agent does not execute anything.

> **Note:** The example `agent_example.yaml` and `agentrun_example.yaml`
> reference the Vertex AI Gateway (`gcp-vertex-ai`) from Option A. If
> you created a different Gateway (Options B–D), update the
> `spec.gateways[].ref` in the Agent and the `spec.gateway` in the
> AgentRun to match your Gateway's name before applying them.

Verify the default SkillCards were deployed (from step 3):

```bash
kubectl get skillcards -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

Apply the example Agent:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/agent_example.yaml -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

Check that the Agent is ready (referenced Gateways and SkillCards
must exist and be healthy):

```bash
kubectl get agents -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

## 6. Create an AgentRun

An AgentRun triggers execution of an Agent. It references an Agent,
selects a Gateway, carries task-specific instructions, and sets the
environment the entry point needs. The controller validates the
configuration, creates an Agent Sandbox, and tracks the run to
completion.

The `agent-java` image resolves the repository to migrate and its git
credentials from the Hub installed in step 2, keyed by `APP_ID`, so the
application has to exist in Hub first. Register it through the UI
(Application inventory → Create new) or the API, using the Hub
port-forward from [Open the UI](#open-the-ui):

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/applications \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"coolstore","repository":{"kind":"git","url":"https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/coolstore.git","branch":"main"}}'

# Find its id — this is the APP_ID the run needs
curl -s http://localhost:8080/applications | jq -r '.[] | "\(.id) \(.name)"'
```

Private repositories also need a git credential (an Identity in Hub)
attached to the application. The sample AgentRun's `spec.env` points at
the in-cluster Hub service with `APP_ID: "1"`; edit `HUB_BASE_URL`,
`APP_ID`, and `TARGET_BRANCH` to match your Hub and application.

> With authentication on, create runs through the UI or Hub's
> `POST /agentic/agentruns` rather than `kubectl apply`: Hub mints a
> per-run token the harness uses to reach Hub, and a run created straight
> in Kubernetes has none. See [Authentication](#authentication).

Apply the example AgentRun:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/agentrun_example.yaml -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

Watch the run:

```bash
kubectl get agentruns -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" -w
```

Once the phase moves to `Running`, the Sandbox pod is live. View
agent logs:

```bash
# Get the sandbox pod name from the AgentRun status
SANDBOX=$(kubectl get agentrun migration-run-001 -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" -o jsonpath='{.status.sandboxName}')
kubectl logs -f $SANDBOX -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
```

The AgentRun spec is **immutable** — to change values, delete the
AgentRun and create a new one.

## 7. Workflows (optional)

For multi-stage work (e.g. plan, execute, verify), use
AgentWorkflow and AgentWorkflowRun. See
`hack/harness-test/workflow-resources.yaml` for a complete example
that migrates a Java EE application to Quarkus using three stages.

## Authentication

Everything above runs with Hub authentication off. Turning it on is one
field on the Tackle CR; the operator restarts Hub and the UI with
`AUTH_REQUIRED=true`:

```bash
kubectl patch tackle tackle -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"feature_auth_required":true}}'
kubectl -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" rollout status deploy/tackle-hub deploy/tackle-ui
```

(`AUTH_REQUIRED=true make konveyor-install` does the same on a fresh
install.) What that means in practice:

- **Hub is its own OpenID Connect provider.** There is no Keycloak to
  install. The UI redirects to Hub's login page, and the issuer is derived
  from the request host, so any UI that proxies `/oidc` to Hub works
  without registering redirect URIs.
- **The seeded login is `admin` / `admin`**, from
  `internal/auth/seed/users.yaml` in tackle2-hub. Change it before the
  cluster is reachable by anyone else; users and roles are managed under
  Hub's `/auth` REST API and the UI's administration pages.
- **Every Hub request now needs credentials.** Anonymous calls return
  `401`. Basic auth works for scripts, and the UI uses bearer tokens:

  ```bash
  curl -s -u admin:admin http://localhost:8080/agentic/agents | jq -r '.[].name'
  ```

- **Agentic endpoints are scoped.** Each route group requires an
  `agentic.*` scope (`agentic.agents`, `agentic.agentruns`, …), granted by
  role in `internal/auth/seed/roles.yaml`. A user whose role lacks them
  gets `403` on the agentic pages while the rest of the UI works.
- **Runs must be created through Hub.** When Hub creates an AgentRun it
  also creates a per-run token Secret, attaches it via `envFrom`, and
  sets `HUB_BASE_URL`, which is how the harness resolves the application
  and pushes results. A run created with `kubectl apply` has no token and
  fails as soon as it talks to Hub.
- **A UI Deployment you run yourself** (developer path) needs
  `AUTH_REQUIRED=true`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID=web-ui`, and
  `OIDC_ISSUER=http://tackle-hub.$KONVEYOR_NS.svc:8080/oidc`. The UI
  server exits at startup without `OIDC_ISSUER`.

## Sample and default manifests

**Samples** (`config/samples/`) are illustrative CRs you copy and edit —
nothing here is auto-installed:

| File | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `gateway_vertex_ai.yaml` | Gateway | GCP Vertex AI with Claude |
| `gateway_openai.yaml` | Gateway | OpenAI GPT-4o |
| `gateway_anthropic.yaml` | Gateway | Anthropic direct API |
| `gateway_aws_bedrock.yaml` | Gateway | AWS Bedrock |
| `gateway_xai.yaml` | Gateway | xAI (Grok) |
| `agent_example.yaml` | Agent | Standalone Java migration agent |
| `agentrun_example.yaml` | AgentRun | Triggers the example agent |

**Defaults** (`config/defaults/`) are the curated content the operator
installs on enable — the skill catalog plus the Agents and AgentWorkflow
the UI runs. Apply them with `kubectl apply -k config/defaults/ -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"`:

| File | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `skillcard_*.yaml` | SkillCard | Migration-stage skills (plan, execute, verify, javaee-to-quarkus, house-rules) |
| `skillcollection_java_migration.yaml` | SkillCollection | Grouped migration skills |
| `agent_migration_*.yaml` | Agent | Plan, execute, and verify stage agents (no gateway — named at run time) |
| `agentworkflow_javaee_to_quarkus.yaml` | AgentWorkflow | Three-stage Java EE → Quarkus workflow |

## Local development

Run the controller locally against a cluster (CRDs must be
installed):

```bash
make install   # Install CRDs
make run       # Run the controller from your host
```

## End-to-end testing with Kind

The project includes scripts for running the full stack in a Kind
cluster:

```bash
make e2e-setup    # Create Kind cluster + deploy Agent Sandbox + controller
make e2e-run      # Run e2e tests
make e2e-cleanup  # Tear down the Kind cluster
```

## Cleanup

`kubectl delete --all` acts on one namespace — keep the `-n` so you
don't remove resources you meant to keep:

```bash
# Delete runs, agents, and gateways in the Hub namespace
kubectl delete agentruns --all -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
kubectl delete agents --all -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"
kubectl delete gateways.konveyor.io --all -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"

# Gateway verification Jobs (and their pods) are owned by the Gateway and
# go with it; sweep any left behind by a Gateway deleted another way
kubectl delete jobs -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" -l app.kubernetes.io/component=gateway-verification
```

> **Warning:** `make undeploy` and `make uninstall` delete the CRDs,
> which are cluster-scoped. Deleting a CRD removes **every** custom
> resource of that type across **all** namespaces — not just the ones
> from this guide. Run these only if you intend to tear down the
> controller entirely.

```bash
# Undeploy the controller
make undeploy

# Or just uninstall CRDs
make uninstall
```

## Operator integration

The tackle2-operator (OLM-packaged as konveyor/operator) ships the agentic
controller behind `spec.agentic_enabled` on the Tackle CR — see the
operator path in step 3. On every merge to `main`, the
`sync-operator` workflow renders this repo's CRDs, controller RBAC, and
`config/defaults/` into a PR against the operator, so what the operator
installs is what this repo defines. Hub's ServiceAccount gets the
`konveyor.io` RBAC from the operator as of
[konveyor/operator#614](https://github.com/konveyor/operator/pull/614)
(v0.11.0-alpha.4); `config/hub-rbac/` here covers older operators. One thing
the operator does not do yet is resolve the Agent Sandbox dependency —
install it yourself (step 1). The kustomize / `dist/install.yaml`
path in step 3 remains the way to run a controller build the operator does
not ship.

## Troubleshooting

**UI agentic pages (Agent runs, Agents) show an error or never load; Hub returns 500**

The UI calls Hub's `/hub/agentic/*` endpoints and Hub reads the
`konveyor.io` resources from its own namespace. A Hub log line like

```
agents.konveyor.io is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:konveyor-tackle:tackle-hub"
cannot list resource "agents" in API group "konveyor.io" in the namespace "konveyor-tackle"
```

means one or both of:

- Hub's ServiceAccount has no Role on `konveyor.io` resources in its
  namespace. Apply `config/hub-rbac/` there (step 2). If the Role exists
  but in a *different* namespace, it does nothing — the namespace in the
  error is the one that matters.
- The Agents, Gateways, and credential Secrets were created in another
  namespace (often whatever the kubectl context defaulted to). Hub cannot
  see them from `konveyor-tackle`. Recreate them in the Hub namespace with
  the `-n "$KONVEYOR_NS"` commands above; the cluster-scoped controller
  reconciles them wherever they are.

Confirm with `kubectl auth can-i list agents.konveyor.io
--as=system:serviceaccount:konveyor-tackle:tackle-hub -n konveyor-tackle`
and `kubectl get agents.konveyor.io -n konveyor-tackle`.

**Gateway shows `Verified: false`**

The controller could not reach the endpoint. Check:
- The endpoint URL is correct
- The credential Secret exists and has the right keys
- Network policies allow egress from the controller namespace

For `aws-bedrock` and `gcp-vertex-ai` this is expected on controller
images older than [#222](https://github.com/konveyor/agentic-controller/pull/222):
the probe asks the endpoint for `/v1/models`, which only OpenAI-compatible
APIs serve, so the verification Job fails with a 404 and the Gateway parks
at `Ready=False/ConnectionFailed`, taking every Agent that references it
down with it. From #222 on, those providers are marked
`Ready=True` with `reason=VerificationSkipped` and `Verified: false`. On an
older image, mark the Gateway Ready by hand:

```bash
kubectl patch gateway.konveyor.io <name> -n "$KONVEYOR_NS" --subresource=status --type=merge \
  -p '{"status":{"connectionVerified":true,"conditions":[{"type":"Ready","status":"True","reason":"ConnectionVerified","message":"Manually verified; /v1/models probe is invalid for this provider","lastTransitionTime":"'"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"'"}]}}'
```

**Hub returns `401` after enabling authentication**

Every caller now needs credentials — see [Authentication](#authentication).
The usual culprits are scripts calling Hub without `-u user:password` or a
bearer token, and AgentRuns created with `kubectl apply`, whose harness
has no Hub token. Recreate those runs through the UI or Hub's API.

**Agent shows `Ready: False`**

The Agent references Gateways or SkillCards that don't exist or
aren't ready. Check:
- `kubectl get gateways.konveyor.io -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"` — all referenced gateways must exist
- `kubectl get skillcards -n "$KONVEYOR_NS"` — all referenced skills must be resolved

**AgentRun stuck in `Pending`**

The controller is waiting for dependencies. Check:
- The referenced Agent is `Ready`
